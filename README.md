# MIPS Assembly: Tic-Tac-Toe
## Overview
Welcome to my implementation of tic-tac-toe in MIPS Assembly language!

## Purpose
Mostly for fun. But also to truly appreciate the beauty of abstraction - and high-level languages! You can't value what you have until it's gone!

Also, in the spirit of understanding how a computer works, in my pursuit of pealing every layer of abstraction.

## How to Run
The best way to run this game is in a MIPS emulator, like the MARS emulator (download here: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/download.htm)

In an emulator, simply run the code - it's that easy! Instructions to play the game are shown on the console upon successful start.

Enjoy :)
